See pre-fetching behavior for a typical tiktok base session
Collect PCAP logs generally and test for 5Mbps for a couple links (3 links - 15seconds versus very long)
One request vs DASH - look historically for past information
Look into papers or stackoverflow, information retrieval for tiktok


2 Slides on Introduction/Motivation - what is the problem solving, why is it important
geosync satellite, statistic on tiktok usage, why does this matter
15 minutes, how tiktok works, how we figured it out, fetching behavior, structure, lack of DASH
8-10 minutes, analyze data and conclusion, ucsb vs satellite network compaison, 3 Mbps vs 5 Mbps


Does Tiktok use constant birate encoding? I know the response size of a video, 
I can therefore compute the playback bitrate of this video, do all videos have 
similar playback bitrate?

Does pre-fetching correlate to bandwidth. I can compute the number of prefetch 
videos in the 60 seconds I collect, and I can simply count the average for each bandwidth
